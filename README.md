## Template Maintenance

1 - Setup to allow incoming merge from upstream template update

```bash
# run once only after you `clone`, or `fork` or `delete .git and run git init`
./setup-upstream.sh
```

2 - Updating the template

```bash
# Commit and push to remote before running commands below
git fetch upstream # includes tags
git pull upstream <branch or tag> --no-rebase
# NO MORE IN USE git merge upstream/<branch or tag> --allow-unrelated-histories
# There may be some template related merge conflicts to resolve.
```

## Description

This repository is a monorepo template for building full-stack JavaScript applications with Node.js, Express, and Vue.

It combines backend application examples in `apps/`, frontend application examples in `webs/`, and shared reusable code in `common/` so teams can start new services and web apps from a consistent structure instead of assembling the stack from scratch.

The repository is designed as a practical starting point for API services, browser applications, and supporting platform code, with workspace-based package management, shared schemas and utilities, sample authentication flows, OpenAPI tooling, Docker support, GitHub Actions workflows, and MCP server examples.

Use it when you want a single repository that can host:

- Express-based backend services
- Vue and Vite frontend applications
- shared ESM modules for Node, browser, Vue, and isomorphic code
- common `zod` schemas and supporting utilities
- deployment, documentation, and database helper scripts
- sample implementations for features such as SAML, OIDC, OAuth, OTP, FIDO2, and push notifications


## Documentation Map

Use these documents depending on the part of the repository you are working on:

> Before opening an issue or pull request, read [.github/CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). It defines the contributor workflow for this repository, including setup, hooks, issue reporting, commit expectations, and pull request rules.

- [.github/CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) - contributor setup, hooks, issue reporting, and pull request guidance
- [docs/git.md](docs/git.md) - git workflow, release flow, tags, and merge strategy
- [docs/conventions.md](docs/conventions.md) - coding, tooling, commit, and runtime conventions
- [docs/NOTES.md](docs/NOTES.md) - internal notes, caveats, and open questions

## General Contents

- apps: backend applications workspaces
- common: shared JavaScript used by `apps` and `webs`
  - TODO: packages that can be uploaded to npm and then installed (OPTIONAL)
- docs: documentation
- scripts: deployment and documentation scripts
- webs: frontend applications using Vue and vanilla JavaScript workspaces


## Project Guides

Use the following guides depending on what you want to build or extend in this repository:

- Backend services: [docs/install-backend.md](docs/install-backend.md)
  Start from the sample Express application in `apps/` and use it as the baseline for new Node.js services.
- Frontend applications: [docs/install-frontend.md](docs/install-frontend.md)
  Use the sample Vue and Vite applications in `webs/` as scaffolding for new browser-based projects.
- Shared code and schemas: [docs/install-common.md](docs/install-common.md)
  Reference the reusable modules in `common/` for Node, browser, Vue, isomorphic utilities, and shared `zod` schemas.


## CI/CD

- [Deploy backend to container registry](.github/workflows/deploy-cr.yml)
- [Publish a package to npm](.github/workflows/deploy-npm.yml)
- [Deploy frontend (Vue) to object store](.github/workflows/deploy-bucket.yml)
